# NCAA ASCII pre processing info

# preprocessing is prior to signal processing

# iterate over all unique exams, 
# within each exam, iterate over each unique series
# within each series, iterate over each chart

1) set the range to max-min arbitrary range of 20000
(NCCA ASCII spec permits values between 1 and 999999)
More scaling is done later for aesthetics.


2) offset each sensor column so the initial value is 0.
More offsetting is done later for aesthetics.

3) check and fix the events data frame.

Some events may not have an answer location. 
So we use the location one sample after stimulus offset 

Check for, and fix, annotations within a stimulus event.
which create a problem of two simultaneous events, 
or a problem of a single event that appears to start, stop, start, and stop,
which then appears to be two events instead of one

Check that events are not overlapping

Check that the verbal answer point is actually after the stimulus offset 

Check that the stimulus offset is actually after the stimnulus onset

Check that all events are in all charts
Check for missing events
Check for repeated events and rename as necessary
most algorithms require each event to have a unique name.
